Hi Professor, AIs,

Greetings!!!

We have uploaded the following files:

Team_No_Show_EDA.Rmd --> Main Code file with all the visualizations for the Q1 and Q2 of the Research Questionnnaire
pred_eda_proj.Rmd --> Feature Engineering and Predictive Modeling is done in this file related to Q3.
No-show-Issue-Comma-300k.csv --> Data file
S670 Exploratory Data Analysis Final Project Report.pdf --> Documentation(12 pages of documentation + 5 pages of Appendix)

The Rmd files have been run and the visualizations mentioned in the documentation are completely reproducible from our code.
As a matter of proof we have knitted the HTML files for the same and uploaded them as well.
